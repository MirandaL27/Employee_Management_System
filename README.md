# Employee Management System

# Description
The purpose of this project was to create an employee management system in which the user is presented with a series of actions that effect a related employee database.  It enabled me to practice SQL queries with mySQL2, practice using inquirer to capture user input, and format output with console.table.

# Installation
npm install

# Usage
node index

# Features
* The user is presented with a series of options to view, add and update database enties
* The user is continually prompted to take actions until they choose the exit option, at which point the program ends.
* User input is validated and certain fields are required.
